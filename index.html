        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a highly motivated person with plenty of potential and I am seeking a position where I can further my knowledge in a fast paced environment where I can leverage my skills in. Currently I am finishing my last quarter at the University of California Riverside, and I will be receiving my Bachelors of Arts in June of 2020. I am a native Spanish speaker and I am currently working as a licensed cosmetologist. In this field I managed to provide excellent customer service and salon cleanliness while at the same time refining my skills in product inventory upkeep, receptionist tasks, maintain a steady flow of clientele, keep service outcomes in the art of cosmetology and barbery consistent, and juggle between chemical services and haircuts in a clean and professional manner. In this field the pace fluctuates from fast to steady, but for the most part a salon environment is a fast paced environment with clientele of all backgrounds. I have been a cosmetologist for the past 11+ years, and I have grown in this field with each passing year gaining more responsibilities such as opening and closing salons, closing salon registers and maintaining full stock of product by handling inventory.<br><br>
        My first job was at a clothing store where my position was a sales clerk. My customer service skills were at a developing stage due to the fact that I volunteered to work at a french restaurant where I familiarized myself with the different demographics and personalities of customers. As a sales clerk my duties were to maintain a clean and organized store while providing great customer service and closing the register. My skills were becoming refined as my responsibilities became bigger.<br><br> 
        At my next job I became a licensed cosmetologist and started working in small salons where the pay was commission based. I started as someone that had no knowledge of how to do hair, let alone do my own hair. I started from zero and cultivated my own technique to the craft. This refining of technique took almost 6 years of my career to become perfected and flawless. While trying to perfect my craft, I also had to continue refining my customer service skills, and maintain salon cleanliness.<br><br>
        After perfecting my skills and learning much more along the way, I decided to focus on my education and earn my Bachelor of Arts in something that I love. My career as a cosmetologist helped me throughout my college life by helping with the financial strains that come with going to college. I managed to work my way through school, while at the same time continue my career as a cosmetologist. In June of 2020, I will finally achieve my goal of earning my degree while being honored for having the experience I have now in the beauty industry. I know after all is done I will have the confidence to branch out of the beauty industry and dive into something that will be my passion. Being a cosmetologist has prepared me with skills that I know will be essential to my career while helping me become the confident person I am today.
